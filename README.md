# .damymetzke, my personal settings

These are a collection of settings I personally use.
These are settings for:

- Bash
- Git
- Vim

If you want to use this as a starting point for your own settings you shoud consider changing the name of the folder.
`/bash/exports.sh` exports the environment variable `$CUSTOM_USER_CONFIG`.
Update this value to change the folder name.

All configuration is both modular and explained with comments.
